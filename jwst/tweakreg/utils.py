    Apply corrections to an imaging WCS of 'cal' data models.

    .. warning::
        This function is not designed to handle neither FITS WCS nor
        GWCS of resampled images. It is designed specifically for GWCS of
        calibrated imaging data models that can be used as input to Stage 3
        of the JWST pipeline (with suffixes '_cal', '_tweakreg', '_skymatch').

    .. warning::
        This function modifies the WCS of calibrated imaging data models in a
        way that is NOT compatible with ``tweakreg``: once a WCS
        was modified using ``adjust_wcs()``, the corresponding imaging data
        model (whose WCS was modified) no longer be aligned using the
        ``tweakreg`` step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wcs : `gwcs.WCS`
        WCS object to be adjusted. Must be an imaging JWST WCS of a calibrated
        data model.
    delta_ra : float, astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        Additional rotation (in degrees if units not provided) to be applied
        along the longitude direction.
    delta_dec : float, astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        Additional rotation (in degrees if units not provided) to be applied
        along the latitude direction.
    delta_roll : float, astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        Additional rotation (in degrees if units not provided) to be applied
        to the telescope roll angle (rotation about V1 axis).
    scale_factor : float, optional
        A multiplicative scale factor to be applied to the current scale
        (if any) in the WCS. If input ``wcs`` does not have a scale factor
        applied, it is assumed to be 1. The scale factor is applied in
        a tangent plane perpendicular to the V1 axis of the telescope.

    Returns

    wcs : `gwcs.WCS`
        Adjusted WCS object.

def transfer_wcs_correction(to_image, from_image, matrix=None, shift=None):
    """
    Apply WCS corrections from one image to another.

    Applies the same *total* WCS correction that was applied by ``tweakreg`` (!)
    to the WCS in the ``from_image`` data model to the WCS of the ``to_image``
    data model. In some ways this function is analogous function to the
    ``tweakback`` function for HST available in the
    `drizzlepac package <https://github.com/spacetelescope/drizzlepac>`_.

    One fundamental difference between this function and ``tweakback``
    is that JWST data models do not keep a history
    of data's WCS via alternative WCS as it is done in HST data and so it is
    impossible to select and apply only one particular WCS correction if
    there were multiple corrections previously applied to a WCS. The
    tangent-plane correction in JWST WCS is cumulative/total correction.
    If you would like to apply a specific/custom correction, you can do that
    via ``matrix`` and ``shift`` arguments which is defined in the
    reference tangent plane provided by the ``from_image``'s WCS.

    When providing your own corrections via ``matrix`` and ``shift`` arguments,
    this function is similar to the :py:func:`adjust_wcs` function
    but provides an alternative way of specifying corrections via affine
    transformations in a reference tangent plane.

    .. warning::
        Upon return, if the ``to_image`` argument is an `ImageModel` it will be
        modified in-place with an updated ``ImageModel.meta.wcs`` WCS model.
        If ``to_image`` argument is a file name of an ``ImageModel``, that
        model will be read in, its WCS will be updated, and the updated model
        will be written out to the same file. BACKUP the file in ``to_image``
        argument before calling this function.

    .. warning::
        This function does not support input data models whose WCS were
        modified by :py:func:`adjust_wcs`. Only WCS corrections computed by
        either the ``tweakreg`` step or by ``tweakwcs`` package are supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_image : str, ImageModel
        Image model to which the correction should be applied/transferred to.

        .. warning::
            If it is a string file name then, upon return, this file
            will be **overwritten** with a data model with an updated WCS.

    from_image : str, ImageModel, gwcs.wcs.WCS
        A data model whose WCS was previously corrected.
        This data model plays two roles: 1) it is the reference WCS which
        provides a tangent plane in which corrections have been defined, and
        2) it provides WCS corrections to be applied to ``to_image``'s
        WCS.

        If the WCS of the ``from_image`` data model does not contain
        corrections, then *both* ``matrix`` *and* ``shift`` arguments *must be
        supplied*.

    matrix : 2D list, 2D numpy.ndarray, None, optional
        A 2D matrix part of an affine transformation defined in the tangent
        plane derived from the ``from_image``'s WCS.

        .. note::
            When provided, ``shift`` argument *must also be provided* in
            which case ``matrix`` and ``shift`` arguments override the
            correction (if present) from the  ``from_file``'s WCS.

    shift : list, numpy.ndarray, None, optional
        A list of length 2 representing the translational part of an affine
        transformation (in arcsec) defined in the tangent plane derived
        from the ``from_image``'s WCS.

        .. note::
            When provided, ``matrix`` argument *must also be provided* in
            which case ``matrix`` and ``shift`` arguments override the
